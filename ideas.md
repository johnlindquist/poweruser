# Agent SDK Ideas

## 1. Documentation Sync Agent
An agent that monitors code changes and automatically updates documentation:
- Detects function/API signature changes
- Updates README files with new features
- Generates/updates inline code comments
- Creates changelog entries
Uses `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` hooks to track file modifications.

## 2. Codebase Health Monitor
A background agent that periodically analyzes project health:
- Tracks technical debt over time
- Monitors dependency vulnerabilities
- Analyzes code complexity metrics
- Generates health reports with actionable recommendations
Uses MCP servers to integrate with external tools (SonarQube, npm audit, etc.).

## 3. Smart Refactoring Assistant
An agent that suggests and applies refactorings:
- Identifies code duplication
- Suggests extract method/class opportunities
- Safely renames symbols across files
- Converts callbacks to async/await
Uses `canUseTool` for permission control on bulk edits.

## 4. API Client Generator
An agent that generates type-safe API clients from OpenAPI specs:
- Fetches OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- Generates TypeScript/Python client code
- Creates tests for each endpoint
- Updates clients when specs change
Uses `WebFetch` to retrieve specs and `Write`/`Edit` for code generation.

## 5. Interactive Migration Assistant
An agent that helps migrate codebases between frameworks/versions:
- Analyzes current codebase structure and dependencies
- Generates migration plan with step-by-step instructions
- Performs incremental migrations with rollback capability
- Updates imports, API calls, and deprecated patterns
- Runs tests after each migration step to verify correctness
Uses `TodoWrite` for tracking migration progress, hooks for validation, and streaming input mode for user approval at each step.

## 6. Code Quality Gates Agent
An agent that enforces project-specific quality standards in CI/CD:
- Configurable quality rules (test coverage, complexity, duplication)
- Blocks PRs that don't meet thresholds
- Suggests specific improvements to meet standards
- Tracks quality metrics over time with trend analysis
- Generates quality reports for team retrospectives
Uses custom MCP servers for metric collection, `canUseTool` for enforcement, and permission updates for rule management.

## 7. Dependency Upgrade Orchestrator
An agent that safely manages dependency updates across large codebases:
- Analyzes dependency tree and identifies safe upgrade candidates
- Creates isolated branches for each upgrade
- Runs full test suite after each upgrade
- Generates compatibility reports with breaking changes
- Handles transitive dependency conflicts
- Rolls back on test failures and reports issues
Uses subagents to parallelize upgrades, `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` hooks for branch management, and `PostToolUse` hooks to monitor test results.

## 8. Session Replay Debugger
An agent that captures and replays agent sessions for debugging purposes:
- Records complete session history including all tool calls and responses
- Provides time-travel debugging to step through agent decision-making
- Allows inspection of state at any point in the session
- Generates visual timelines of agent actions and reasoning
- Exports session data for sharing and analysis
- Supports breakpoints and conditional pauses during replay
Uses `hooks` to capture all events, `resume` and `forkSession` for replay functionality, and custom MCP servers for session storage.

## 9. Context-Aware Code Suggester
An agent that acts as an intelligent pair programmer monitoring your coding session:
- Watches file edits in real-time using `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` hooks
- Analyzes code changes and suggests improvements proactively
- Catches potential bugs, security issues, and performance problems
- Recommends relevant design patterns and best practices
- Learns project-specific conventions and preferences
- Provides context-aware refactoring suggestions
Uses `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks for monitoring, `includePartialMessages` for streaming feedback, and custom MCP servers for learning storage.
