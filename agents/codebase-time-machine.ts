/**
 * Codebase Time Machine Agent
 *
 * An outside-the-box agent that reconstructs your application's complete state at any point in history:
 * - Uses git history, runtime logs, and code analysis to "replay" development timeline
 * - Visualizes exactly when and why bugs were introduced with full context
 * - Shows the evolution of architectural decisions and feature development
 * - Helps debug time-sensitive issues by understanding what changed between working and broken states
 * - Generates interactive timelines showing how files, functions, and patterns evolved
 * - Identifies the "blast radius" of changes by showing what was affected
 * - Perfect for understanding legacy code decisions and debugging production issues
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run agents/codebase-time-machine.ts [options]
 *   bun run agents/codebase-time-machine.ts --bug "authentication fails after login"
 *   bun run agents/codebase-time-machine.ts --file src/auth.ts --when "2024-01-15"
 *   bun run agents/codebase-time-machine.ts --compare "v1.2.0" "v1.3.0"
 *   bun run agents/codebase-time-machine.ts --blame --pattern "memory leak"

  const fileScope = file ? ` in ${file}` : '';

  return `You are a Codebase Time Machine in Bug Detective mode. Your mission is to travel through time to identify exactly when and why the bug "${target}" was introduced${fileScope}.

## Your Task

Use git history analysis to reconstruct the timeline and pinpoint the moment when things went wrong.

### Phase 1: Initial Investigation
1. **Gather Recent History**
   - Use Bash: \`git log --since="3 months ago" --pretty=format:"%h|%an|%ad|%s" --date=short\`
   ${file ? `- Get detailed history for ${file}: \`git log --follow --pretty=format:"%h|%an|%ad|%s" --date=short -- "${file}"\`` : ''}
   - Identify commits related to: ${target}
   - Look for keywords: bug, fix, hotfix, regression, revert${pattern ? `, "${pattern}"` : ''}

2. **Identify Suspect Commits**
   - Find commits that touch relevant code areas
   - Look for commits shortly before bug reports or fixes
   - Check for commits with suspicious messages (WIP, temp, quick fix)
   - Identify refactorings or architectural changes in the area

3. **Analyze Change Patterns**
   ${file ? `- Use git blame to see line-by-line history: \`git blame "${file}"\`` : ''}
   - Find when specific code sections were last modified
   - Identify who made the changes and when
   - Look for correlations with reported issues

### Phase 2: Timeline Reconstruction
Create a detailed timeline of events:

1. **The Working State**
   - When was the code last known to be working?
   - What was the state of the code at that point?
   - Use: \`git show <commit>:<file>\` to view old versions

2. **The Breaking Change**
   - Identify the exact commit that introduced the issue
   - Extract the full diff: \`git show <commit>\`
   - Understand what changed and why
   - Read commit messages and related code

3. **The Cascade Effect**${includeBlastRadius ? `
   - Identify all files affected by the breaking change
   - Use: \`git diff --name-only <before-commit> <after-commit>\`
   - Analyze dependencies: what else depends on changed code?
   - Use Grep to find references to changed functions/classes
   - Map out the "blast radius" of the change` : ''}

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis
Dig deeper into WHY the bug was introduced:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Use Read to examine the current buggy code
   - Compare it to the working version
   - Identify the logical error or missing edge case
   - Look for assumptions that became invalid

2. **Context Gathering**
   - Was this part of a larger refactoring?
   - Were there time pressures (check commit times)?
   - Were there multiple authors involved?
   - Check for incomplete features or TODOs

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Is this a recurring pattern?
   - Search for similar bugs: \`git log --all --grep="<similar keywords>"\`
   - Have similar mistakes been made before?

### Phase 4: Generate Report
Create a comprehensive report at ${outputPath} with:

#### Bug Detective Report: ${target}

**Executive Summary**
- One paragraph summary of what happened

**Timeline of Events**
\`\`\`
üìÖ YYYY-MM-DD | Code was working (commit: abc123)

   - Look for refactorings, features, and bug fixes
   - Track complexity growth
   - Identify architectural shifts

3. **Pattern Evolution**
   - How did coding patterns change?
   - What technologies were adopted/deprecated?
   - How did testing strategies evolve?
   ${file ? `- Use git blame to see line-by-line evolution: \`git blame "${file}"\`` : ''}

### Phase 2: Create Evolution Report
Generate a comprehensive report at ${outputPath} with:

#### Evolution Report: ${target}
