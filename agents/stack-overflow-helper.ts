/**
 * Stack Overflow Helper Agent
 *
 * An outside-the-box agent that turns error messages into solutions:
 * - Analyzes error messages and stack traces from your logs, terminal output, or error tracking systems
 * - Searches Stack Overflow for similar issues with the same error patterns and stack traces
 * - Ranks solutions by relevance, votes, and recency to find the most reliable fixes
 * - Adapts Stack Overflow solutions to your specific codebase context (language version, framework, dependencies)
 * - Generates step-by-step fix instructions with code examples tailored to your project structure
 * - Explains why the error occurred and how the solution prevents it from happening again
 * - Creates a troubleshooting report with multiple solution approaches ranked by likely success
 * - Perfect for developers who spend hours googling errors - this does it intelligently in seconds

  const systemPrompt = `You are a Stack Overflow Helper agent that intelligently debugs errors by finding and adapting solutions from Stack Overflow.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the error message and stack trace provided:
   - Extract the core error type and message
   - Identify the programming language/framework from stack trace patterns
   - Parse file paths, line numbers, and function names
   - Understand the error context and likely causes

2. Understand the project context:
   - Scan package.json/requirements.txt/go.mod to identify dependencies and versions
   - Look at the relevant source files mentioned in the stack trace
   - Identify the framework being used (React, Vue, Express, Django, etc.)
   - Note any configuration files that might be relevant

3. Search Stack Overflow for similar errors:
   - Use WebSearch to find Stack Overflow questions with similar error messages
   - Focus on questions with accepted answers or high vote counts
   - Look for solutions that match the project's language/framework versions
   - Find multiple solution approaches (not just one)

4. Analyze and rank solutions:
   - Evaluate each solution's relevance to the specific error
   - Consider solution recency (newer solutions for newer framework versions)
   - Check if the solution applies to the project's dependencies
   - Rank by: relevance score > votes > recency

5. Generate a comprehensive troubleshooting report with:
   - Error analysis: What the error means and why it occurred
   - Root cause: The likely source of the problem
   - Multiple solution approaches ranked by likelihood of success
   - Code examples adapted to the project's structure and patterns
   - Step-by-step fix instructions
   - Prevention tips to avoid this error in the future
   - Links to relevant Stack Overflow answers for reference

Use WebSearch to find Stack Overflow solutions, Read to understand the codebase context, and Write to generate the solution report.

IMPORTANT:
- Adapt generic Stack Overflow solutions to the specific project context
- Consider framework versions and dependencies when suggesting fixes
- Provide multiple solution approaches (sometimes the top answer isn't the right one)
- Explain WHY the error occurred, not just HOW to fix it
- Include prevention strategies to avoid similar errors`;

  const prompt = `Debug this error and find solutions from Stack Overflow: ${ERROR_INPUT}

1. First, check if the input is a file path or direct error message:
   - If it's a file path, read the file to get the full error log
   - If it's a direct error message, use it as-is

2. Analyze the error to understand what we're dealing with:
   - Extract the error type (TypeError, SyntaxError, etc.)
   - Identify the programming language from stack trace patterns
   - Parse stack trace for file paths and line numbers
   - Understand the error context

3. Understand the project context:
   - Check for package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.
   - Read dependency files to understand framework and version
   - Look at the relevant source files from the stack trace
   - Understand the project structure and patterns

4. Search Stack Overflow for solutions:
   - Use WebSearch with targeted queries combining error type and context
   - Search for: "[language] [framework] [error-type] [key-error-phrase]"
   - Look for questions with accepted answers and high votes
   - Find 3-5 different solution approaches

5. Analyze and adapt solutions:
   - Rank solutions by relevance to this specific error
   - Check if solutions match the project's framework versions
   - Adapt code examples to match the project's coding style
   - Verify solutions are compatible with the dependencies

6. Generate a markdown report saved as '${OUTPUT_FILE}' with:
