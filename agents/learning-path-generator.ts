 * Learning Path Generator
 *
 * An outside-the-box agent that creates personalized learning roadmaps based on your code.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Analyzes your current codebase and tech stack to understand your skill level
 * - Identifies gaps in your knowledge based on modern best practices and industry trends
 * - Generates a structured learning path with curated resources, exercises, and projects
 * - Suggests open source contributions aligned with your learning goals
 * - Tracks progress by analyzing your new commits and projects over time
 * - Creates portfolio projects that demonstrate your growing expertise
 * - Connects learning objectives to real career opportunities and job requirements
 *
 * Perfect for developers who want to level up but don't know where to focus.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run agents/learning-path-generator.ts [directory] [target-role]
 *
 * Examples:
 *   bun run agents/learning-path-generator.ts
 *   bun run agents/learning-path-generator.ts . "Senior Frontend Engineer"

Analyze the codebase at: ${targetDir}

Target role: ${targetRole}

Please perform the following analysis:

1. **Tech Stack Analysis**
   - Identify all languages, frameworks, and tools used in the codebase
   - Use Grep and Glob to find package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, etc.
   - Analyze the code patterns and architecture to understand skill level
   - Determine which technologies are used most heavily

2. **Skill Gap Identification**
   - Based on the current tech stack, identify what's missing for the target role
   - Use WebSearch to research modern best practices for the target role
   - Compare current skills with industry trends and in-demand technologies
   - Identify specific knowledge gaps (e.g., testing, performance, security, etc.)

3. **Learning Path Generation**
   Create a structured learning roadmap with:
   - 3-5 major learning objectives prioritized by impact
   - For each objective:
     * Why it matters for the target role
     * Estimated time to learn (be realistic)
     * Curated resources (official docs, courses, books, articles)
     * Hands-on exercises and projects to practice
     * How to demonstrate this skill in your portfolio

4. **Open Source Contribution Suggestions**
   - Suggest 5-10 open source projects aligned with learning goals
   - Use WebSearch to find projects in the same tech stack
   - Prioritize projects with "good first issue" tags
   - Explain how contributing to each project will help skill development

5. **Portfolio Project Ideas**
   - Suggest 2-3 portfolio projects that fill skill gaps
   - Projects should demonstrate new skills to potential employers
   - Include: problem statement, tech stack, key features, complexity estimate

6. **Career Connection**
   - Map the learning path to job requirements (use WebSearch for job postings)
   - Estimate timeline to become competitive for target role
   - Suggest how to showcase progress (blog posts, GitHub, LinkedIn)

7. **Progress Tracking Plan**
   - Suggest how to track progress using git commits and projects
   - Create milestones for the first 30, 60, and 90 days
   - Set up a system for regular self-assessment

**Output Format:**
Generate a comprehensive markdown document named \`learning-path-${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.md\` with all the information above, beautifully formatted with:
- Executive summary at the top
- Clear sections with headings and subheadings
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Links to resources
- Checkboxes for tracking progress
- Motivational language to keep developers engaged

Be specific, actionable, and encouraging. This roadmap should transform aimless learning into a strategic career investment.

IMPORTANT: Write the final learning path to a file using the Write tool.`;
