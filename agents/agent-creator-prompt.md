Read @ideas.md

## SETUP:

1. ULTRATHINK! Come up with 3 new ideas for how to use the Agent SDK.
  a. One idea should be outside-the-box thinking to help devs achieve their dreams
  b. One idea should be a practical, everyday use case
  c. One idea should be focused on a tiny task/script that runs quickly
2. Then add them to @ideas.md
3. Pick your favorite from the @ideas.md that haven't been implemented yet.
4. Remove the idea from the @ideas.md.
5. If there are more than 9 ideas, remove the least interesting idea so we only have a maximum of 9 ideas.

## BUILD:
Build out the idea to "./agents/<idea>.ts" file as a Bun/TypeScript agent.

## Rules
1. NEVER run the idea
2. Once the new idea is build, run "bun run typecheck" and fix any errors
