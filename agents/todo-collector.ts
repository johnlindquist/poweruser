/**
 * TODO Collector Agent
 *
 * A tiny quick-win agent that transforms scattered TODO comments into actionable tasks:
 * - Scans entire codebase for TODO, FIXME, HACK, BUG, and NOTE comments
 * - Extracts context: file path, line number, author, and date when TODO was added
 * - Groups TODOs by priority (FIXME > BUG > TODO > NOTE), category, or author
 * - Generates a clean markdown checklist with links to source locations
 * - Identifies stale TODOs that have been in the code for months
 * - Suggests which TODOs should be converted to GitHub issues
 * - Optionally creates a TODO.md file or GitHub issues automatically

  const systemPrompt = `You are a TODO Collector agent that helps developers track scattered TODO comments across their codebase.

Your task is to:
1. Scan the entire codebase for TODO-style comments:
   - TODO: Standard tasks and reminders
   - FIXME: Things that need fixing
   - HACK: Temporary workarounds that need proper solutions
   - BUG: Known bugs that need addressing
   - NOTE: Important notes or warnings
   - XXX: Critical issues requiring attention

2. For each TODO item found:
   - Extract the full comment text and context
   - Record file path and line number
   - Use git blame to find the author and date when it was added
   - Categorize by priority (FIXME/BUG/XXX > TODO > HACK > NOTE)
   - Identify stale TODOs (older than 90 days)

3. Generate a comprehensive TODO report with:
   - Executive summary (total count by type, oldest TODO, etc.)
   - TODOs grouped by priority level
   - Each TODO with: type, file location, line number, author, age, and description
   - Links to source code locations (file:line format)
   - Suggestions for which TODOs should be converted to GitHub issues
   - Statistics about stale TODOs and technical debt

4. Save the report as a markdown file with checkboxes for easy tracking

${CREATE_ISSUES ? '5. Create GitHub issues for high-priority TODOs (FIXME, BUG, XXX) using gh CLI' : ''}

Use Grep to find TODO comments efficiently, Bash (git blame) to get author/date info, and Write to generate the report.

IMPORTANT:
- Search for common comment patterns across multiple languages (// TODO, # TODO, /* TODO */, etc.)
- Parse the TODO text carefully to extract meaningful descriptions
- Calculate age in days from git blame timestamps
- Group logically for easy action planning
- Make the report actionable with clear priorities`;

  const prompt = `Scan the project at: ${PROJECT_PATH} and collect all TODO-style comments.

1. First, understand the project structure:
   - Use Glob to identify what file types are present
   - Determine which languages are being used (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)

2. Search for TODO comments using Grep:
   - Search for patterns: "TODO:", "FIXME:", "HACK:", "BUG:", "NOTE:", "XXX:"
   - Include context lines (-B 1 -A 1) to capture multi-line comments
   - Search across all source files (respect .gitignore)
   - Capture line numbers for each match

3. For each TODO found, use git blame to get metadata:
   - Author who added the TODO
   - Date when it was added (calculate age in days)
   - Commit hash for reference

4. Organize all TODOs by priority:
   Priority 1 (Critical): FIXME, BUG, XXX
   Priority 2 (Important): TODO
   Priority 3 (Info): HACK, NOTE

5. Generate a markdown report saved as '${OUTPUT_FILE}' with:

   # TODO Report

   ## Summary
   - Total TODOs: X
   - By type: TODO (X), FIXME (X), BUG (X), HACK (X), NOTE (X), XXX (X)
   - Oldest TODO: X days old
   - Stale TODOs (>90 days): X

   ## Priority 1: Critical (FIXME, BUG, XXX)
   - [ ] **FIXME** (file.ts:123) - Description here
     - Author: John Doe
     - Age: 45 days
     - Location: \`src/components/file.ts:123\`

   ## Priority 2: Important (TODO)
   [Same format]

   ## Priority 3: Informational (HACK, NOTE)
   [Same format]

   ## Recommendations
   - Suggest which TODOs should become GitHub issues
   - Highlight stale TODOs that need attention
   - Suggest cleanup opportunities

${CREATE_ISSUES ? `
6. After generating the report, create GitHub issues:
   - Use 'gh issue create' for each Priority 1 TODO
   - Include file location, description, and author info
   - Add labels like 'technical-debt', 'bug', 'refactor'
   - Link back to the source code location
