Follow these steps:

1. **Git History Analysis** (use Bash tool):
   - Get commit history for the past year: git log --since="1 year ago" --pretty=format:"%H|%an|%ae|%ad|%s" --date=iso --numstat
   - Get weekly commit frequency: git log --since="1 year ago" --pretty=format:"%ad" --date=format:"%Y-%W" | sort | uniq -c
   - Get commits by day of week: git log --since="1 year ago" --pretty=format:"%ad" --date=format:"%u" | sort | uniq -c
   - Get commits by hour of day: git log --since="1 year ago" --pretty=format:"%ad" --date=format:"%H" | sort | uniq -c
   - Get file types changed most: git log --since="1 year ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | grep -E '\\.[a-z]+$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
   - Get contributor stats: git shortlog -sn --since="1 year ago"

2. **Technology & Skill Detection** (use Bash/Grep):
   - Identify languages used: Look at file extensions in git history
   - Find frameworks/libraries: Search package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.
   - Detect new technologies adopted: Compare first and last 3 months of commits

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   Analyze the data to identify:
   - **Flow State Periods**: Weeks with high commit frequency and consistent daily patterns
   - **Learning Phases**: Periods with smaller commits, more experimental changes, lots of file additions
   - **Grinding Periods**: High commit volume but smaller changes, likely maintenance work
   - **Peak Productivity Times**: Most common hours and days for commits
   - **Skill Evolution**: New file types, frameworks, or patterns that appeared over time

4. **Web Research** (use WebSearch):
   - Search for current trends in the developer's primary tech stack
   - Find information about major frameworks/libraries used to contextualize their work
   - Look up best practices in their domain (if identifiable)

5. **Generate Comprehensive Report** (use Write):
   Create a beautiful HTML report: ~/career-momentum-report.html

   The report should include:

   **Executive Summary**
   - Overall productivity score (based on consistency and output)
   - Primary technologies and expertise areas
   - Key achievements and growth moments
   - Career trajectory assessment

   **Visual Timeline**
   Use ASCII or text-based charts showing:
   - Commit activity over the past year (monthly bars)
   - Technology adoption timeline
   - Productivity heatmap (day of week √ó hour of day)

   **Period Analysis**
   Break the year into quarters and describe:
   - What technologies were used
   - Commit patterns (flow/learning/grinding)
   - Notable achievements or changes
   - Growth indicators

   **Productivity Insights**
   - Best days and times for coding
   - Average commits per week
   - Longest streaks of activity
   - Patterns in commit sizes and types

   **Skill Evolution**
   - Technologies mastered or adopted
   - Areas of deepening expertise
   - New domains explored
   - Recommendations for continued growth

   **Interview Talking Points**
   Generate 5-7 compelling bullet points like:
   - "Led the migration from X to Y, completing 50+ commits over 2 months"
   - "Demonstrated consistent growth in [skill], with increasing complexity of changes"
   - "Maintained high productivity with 85% of commits during optimal flow state hours"

   **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Optimal schedule for deep work vs shipping features
   - Technologies to learn next based on current trajectory
   - Patterns to optimize (e.g., "commit more frequently" or "break down large changes")

   **Career Momentum Score**: X/10 with explanation

   Use good HTML/CSS styling to make it visually appealing with charts, colors, and sections.

6. **Summary Output**:
   Print to console:
   - Total commits analyzed
   - Date range
   - Primary technologies found
   - Top 3 insights
   - Path to generated report

Remember: Be encouraging and positive. Frame everything as growth and achievement. Make the developer feel proud of their work while providing actionable insights.`;
