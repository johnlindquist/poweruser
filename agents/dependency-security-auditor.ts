/**
 * Dependency Security Auditor Agent
 *
 * A practical everyday agent that keeps your dependencies secure and up-to-date intelligently:
 * - Scans package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml for all dependencies
 * - Checks for known CVEs and security vulnerabilities with severity ratings
 * - Identifies outdated packages and suggests safe upgrade paths
 * - Detects license conflicts that could cause legal issues
 * - Analyzes your actual usage patterns to prioritize critical vs unused dependencies
 * - Generates upgrade plans that minimize breaking changes
 * - Creates pull requests with dependency updates and automated tests
 * - Distinguishes between security patches (urgent) and feature updates (optional)

Your task is to:
1. Find and analyze all dependency files in the project (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.)
2. For each dependency file found:
   - List all dependencies with their current versions
   - Search for known CVEs and security vulnerabilities
   - Check for outdated packages and available updates
   - Identify license issues or conflicts
   - Analyze actual code usage to prioritize critical dependencies
3. Generate a comprehensive security report with:
   - Critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention (HIGH/CRITICAL severity)
   - Moderate vulnerabilities to address soon (MEDIUM severity)
   - Outdated packages with recommended upgrade paths
   - License conflicts or concerns
   - Unused or rarely-used dependencies that could be removed
   - Safe upgrade plan prioritized by risk
4. For each finding, provide:
   - Severity rating
   - CVE ID if applicable
   - Current version vs fixed/recommended version
   - Breaking change assessment
   - Suggested action (upgrade, patch, remove, investigate)

Use Glob to find dependency files, Read to parse them, WebSearch to check for vulnerabilities, and Write to save the security report.

IMPORTANT: Focus on actionable findings. Distinguish between:
- Security patches (urgent) - vulnerabilities with known exploits
- Feature updates (optional) - new versions without security concerns
- Breaking changes - major version upgrades requiring code changes

Keep the report concise but comprehensive. Format it as markdown with clear sections and severity badges.`;

  const prompt = `Analyze all dependencies in the project at: ${PROJECT_PATH}

1. Find all dependency manifest files (package.json, package-lock.json, requirements.txt, Pipfile, go.mod, go.sum, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, etc.)
2. Parse each file and extract dependencies with versions
3. For each dependency, search for:
   - Known CVEs and security advisories
   - Available updates and their severity
   - License information
   - Usage patterns in the codebase
4. Generate a security audit report with:
   - Executive summary with key findings
   - Critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate action
   - Recommended upgrades with risk assessment
   - Unused dependencies that can be removed
   - Safe upgrade strategy prioritized by impact

Save the report as 'dependency-security-audit.md' in the project root.`;
